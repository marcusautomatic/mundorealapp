cy-bracket-notation
Cypress tests

project to demonstrate how to call Cypress and custom commands using the JS bracket notion, instead of the dot notation.

Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v16.13.2 and 8.19.2 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later LTS versions.

Installation
Run npm install (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

Tests
Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open the Cypress App, and run the tests in interactive mode.
